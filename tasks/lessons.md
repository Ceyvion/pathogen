# Lessons

- Avoid "different stages, same winning plan": if a plague type or scenario can be solved with the same build order and play loop every time, it needs a unique mechanic or constraint that changes the decision space.
- Avoid UI interaction annoyance: never spawn short-lived clickable pickups over UI chrome or menus; if a pickup would overlap UI, bank it or respawn it in a safe zone.
- Avoid lazy world text and region modeling: event/ticker content must be state-reactive and location-grounded (specific NYC places, plausible institutions) rather than generic filler.
